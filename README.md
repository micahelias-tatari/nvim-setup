# My NeoVim Setuo

Right now the documentation only supports Mac. Will update as soon as I get it running on Win32.

## Setup

1. Run a `git clone` of the repository in `~/.config/`
2. open `init.lua` in `NeoVim` and run `:PackerSync` to download all setup dependencies
3. fix any problems lmao good luck
